# Implementation Planning: Thinking Framework for Post-Approval Development

This framework guides your thinking process when transforming approved requirements and design into actionable implementation plans. Use it as a mental model, not a rigid checklist.

## Core Principles

**Post-Approval Context**: Requirements and design are locked. Focus on execution strategy, not requirements validation.

**Risk-Aware Planning**: Acknowledge uncertainty and build in mitigation strategies from the start.

**Progressive Delivery**: Balance comprehensive coverage with early value delivery and learning opportunities.

## Thinking Framework

### 1. Strategic Foundation Assessment

**Key Questions to Guide Your Thinking:**
- What's the simplest version that delivers core value while proving system viability?
- Where are the highest technical risks, and how can I surface them early?
- What can be built in parallel vs. what creates critical dependencies?
- Which components are "proven patterns" vs. novel implementations requiring validation?

**Risk Lens:**
- What could go wrong technically? (Integration complexity, performance, data migration)
- Where might effort estimates be most uncertain?
- What external dependencies (APIs, services, teams) could block progress?
- Which assumptions in the design need early validation?

### 2. Architecture Decomposition Strategy

**Think in Terms of Value Streams:**
Instead of technical layers, consider paths that deliver user value:
- What's the shortest path from user action to meaningful system response?
- Which components form the critical path for core use cases?
- Where can I create natural breakpoints for incremental delivery?

**Dependency Analysis:**
- Map true technical dependencies (X needs Y to function)
- Identify integration complexity hotspots
- Consider which components can use mocked/stubbed interfaces initially
- Plan for graceful degradation when possible

**Framework Leverage Strategy:**
- Which standard patterns does our framework handle well? (Start here)
- Where do we need custom solutions? (Higher risk, plan carefully)
- What proven libraries address our exact use case?
- Where might "not invented here" syndrome create unnecessary risk?

### 3. Progressive Implementation Strategy

**Value-First Sequencing:**
Think about delivering value progressively rather than building comprehensively:
1. **Proof of Concept**: Core user journey works end-to-end (may use shortcuts/mocks)
2. **Minimum Viable Product**: Essential features with production-ready foundations
3. **Feature Completion**: Full requirement coverage
4. **Polish and Edge Cases**: Error handling, optimization, edge scenarios

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- After each phase, what can stakeholders interact with?
- How will you validate assumptions before building dependent components?
- Where can automated testing provide confidence without manual validation?
- What integration points need early smoke testing?

### 4. Task Decomposition Approach

**Right-Size Tasks for Risk Management:**
- Complex/risky components: Break into smaller validation steps
- Well-understood patterns: Can be larger, more complete tasks
- Integration points: Separate interface definition from implementation
- External dependencies: Create mocking/testing tasks alongside real implementation

**Task Characteristics to Consider:**
- Can this task be completed and tested in isolation?
- Does this task surface a key technical risk or assumption?
- Can this task be parallelized with others?
- Does this task create outputs needed by multiple downstream tasks?

**Testing Integration:**
- Build test-first for complex business logic
- Create integration tests at component boundaries
- Plan end-to-end scenarios that validate core user value
- Consider performance/load testing for critical paths

### 5. Risk Mitigation Planning

**Technical Risk Categories:**
- **Integration Complexity**: Plan spike tasks for uncertain integrations
- **Performance Unknowns**: Build measurement and testing early
- **External Dependencies**: Create abstraction layers and backup plans
- **Data Migration/Transformation**: Validate with realistic data sets early

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Spikes**: Time-boxed exploration tasks for high-uncertainty areas
- **Parallel Approaches**: Develop alternatives for high-risk components
- **Incremental Rollouts**: Plan for gradual deployment and rollback
- **Circuit Breakers**: Design graceful degradation into system boundaries

### 6. Estimation and Capacity Thinking

**Effort Uncertainty:**
- Which tasks use familiar technologies/patterns? (Lower uncertainty)
- Where are you breaking new ground? (Higher uncertainty, wider ranges)
- What external coordination is required? (Add buffer time)
- Which tasks are on the critical path? (Need realistic estimates)

**Capacity Considerations:**
- Can tasks be parallelized across team members?
- Where do you need specialized skills or knowledge?
- What context-switching costs exist between different types of work?
- How will you handle unexpected obstacles without derailing the timeline?

## Implementation Plan Structure

### Phase-Based Organization
Structure your plan around value delivery phases, not technical layers:

```
Phase 1: Core Value Proof (MVP)
├── Essential data models and basic persistence
├── Core business logic implementation
├── Minimal user interface for primary use case
└── End-to-end integration validation

Phase 2: Production Foundation
├── Robust error handling and validation
├── Security implementation
├── Performance baseline establishment
└── Deployment and monitoring setup

Phase 3: Feature Completion
├── Remaining functional requirements
├── Advanced user interface features
├── Comprehensive test coverage
└── Performance optimization
```

### Task Documentation Framework

**For each task, think through:**

**Objective**: What specific capability does this enable?
**Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High based on uncertainty and complexity
**Dependencies**: What must exist before this can start?
**Validation**: How will you know this works correctly?
**Effort Range**: Conservative estimate with uncertainty range
**Parallel Opportunities**: What else can be worked on simultaneously?

## Quality Validation Questions

**Coverage Check:**
- Does each requirement have a clear implementation path?
- Are all high-risk areas addressed with appropriate mitigation?
- Can you deliver incremental value while building toward complete coverage?

**Sequence Validation:**
- Can each phase be deployed and provide user value?
- Are critical path dependencies clearly identified?
- Do you have early validation points for risky assumptions?

**Risk Assessment:**
- Where could things go wrong, and do you have mitigation plans?
- What would you do if key estimates prove wrong?
- How quickly can you detect and respond to implementation problems?

## Success Indicators

Your implementation plan is ready when you can confidently answer:

- ✅ **Value Path**: How will users get value incrementally as you build?
- ✅ **Risk Management**: What are your top 3 technical risks and mitigation strategies?
- ✅ **Dependency Flow**: What's the critical path, and what can be parallelized?
- ✅ **Validation Strategy**: How will you know if you're on track at each phase?
- ✅ **Effort Reality**: Where are you most uncertain, and how does that affect planning?
- ✅ **Framework Leverage**: What are you building vs. reusing, and why?

The goal is not perfect prediction, but thoughtful preparation that enables rapid adaptation when reality differs from the plan.
