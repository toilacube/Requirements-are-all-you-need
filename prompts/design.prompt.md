# Feature Design Development Guidelines

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for developing comprehensive feature design documents based on approved requirements. The design phase transforms requirements into detailed technical specifications that guide implementation.

## Prerequisites

- **Requirements Document:** Ensure an approved requirements document exists before beginning design
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Confirm all key stakeholders have reviewed and approved the requirements

## Design Development Process

### Phase 1: Research and Context Building

**Research Requirements:**
- Identify areas where additional research is needed based on feature requirements
- Conduct thorough research on relevant technologies, patterns, and best practices
- Build comprehensive context through investigation of:
  - Similar implementations and case studies
  - Technology stack capabilities and limitations
  - Performance benchmarks and scalability patterns
  - Security considerations and compliance requirements
  - Integration patterns with existing systems

**Research Documentation:**
- Summarize key findings that will inform the feature design
- Include sources and relevant links for future reference
- Use research findings as direct input for design decisions
- Maintain research context within the conversation thread rather than separate documents

### Phase 2: Design Document Creation

**Document Structure Requirements:**

The design document must include the following sections:

**1. Overview**
- High-level description of the feature
- Key objectives and success criteria
- Scope and boundaries
- Assumptions and dependencies

**2. Architecture**
- System architecture overview
- Component relationships and data flow
- Integration points with existing systems
- Technology stack decisions and rationale

**3. Components and Interfaces**
- Detailed component descriptions
- API specifications and contracts
- Interface definitions between components
- External service integrations

**4. Data Models**
- Database schema design
- Data structures and relationships
- Data validation rules
- Migration strategies for existing data

**5. Error Handling**
- Error categorization and handling strategies
- Fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation
- Recovery procedures and retry logic
- User-facing error messages and notifications

**6. Testing Strategy**
- Unit testing approach and coverage targets
- Integration testing scenarios
- Performance testing requirements
- Security testing considerations

**Additional Design Elements:**
- Include diagrams and visual representations when helpful (use Mermaid for technical diagrams)
- Highlight key design decisions and provide clear rationales
- Address all feature requirements identified during the clarification process
- Consider future extensibility and maintenance requirements

### Phase 3: Iterative Review and Refinement

**Design Review Process:**
- Present the initial design for stakeholder review
- Request specific feedback on technical decisions and approaches
- Address any concerns or questions about the design
- Make iterative improvements based on feedback

**Feedback Integration:**
- Incorporate all stakeholder feedback into the design document
- Ensure changes maintain consistency across all sections
- Validate that modifications still meet original requirements
- Document any requirement changes or clarifications that emerge

**Approval Criteria:**
- All technical decisions are clearly justified
- Design addresses all approved requirements
- Stakeholders have reviewed and approved the approach
- Risk mitigation strategies are in place
- Implementation path is clear and feasible

### Phase 4: Design Validation

**Technical Validation:**
- Verify design completeness against requirements
- Confirm architectural decisions align with organizational standards
- Validate scalability and performance assumptions
- Review security and compliance considerations

**Gap Analysis:**
- Identify any remaining ambiguities or missing details
- Highlight areas that may require additional requirements clarification
- Flag potential implementation challenges or risks
- Suggest areas for prototyping or proof-of-concept work

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing the design document, ensure:

- [ ] All requirements are addressed in the design
- [ ] Architecture supports current and future scale requirements
- [ ] Error handling covers both expected and unexpected scenarios
- [ ] Security considerations are integrated throughout
- [ ] Performance requirements have clear implementation strategies
- [ ] Testing approach validates all critical functionality
- [ ] Dependencies and integration points are clearly defined
- [ ] Maintenance and operational concerns are addressed
- [ ] Design decisions include clear rationales
- [ ] Visual diagrams enhance understanding where appropriate

## Success Indicators

A successful design document:
- Provides clear guidance for implementation teams
- Addresses all stakeholder concerns and requirements
- Includes comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- Demonstrates consideration of long-term maintainability
- Incorporates industry best practices and lessons learned
- Enables accurate effort estimation for implementation
- Serves as effective documentation for future system evolution
