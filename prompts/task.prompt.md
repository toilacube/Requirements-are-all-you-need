# Implementation Planning: Chain of Thought Process

Follow this step-by-step chain of thought process to transform your approved feature design into a comprehensive, actionable implementation plan.

## Step 1: Foundation Assessment and Preparation

### 1.1 Verify Prerequisites
**Think through these questions:**
- Do I have an approved requirements document with clear functional and technical specifications?
- Is my design document complete and approved by stakeholders?
- Are there any gaps between requirements and design that need clarification?

**Action:** If any prerequisites are missing, stop and address them before proceeding.

### 1.2 Analyze Requirements Granularity
**Mental process:**
- Review each requirement in the requirements document
- Identify which requirements are simple enough for single tasks
- Determine which complex requirements need to be broken into multiple implementation steps
- Note any requirements that have dependencies on other requirements

**Document your thinking:** Create a mental map of requirement complexity and interdependencies.

## Step 2: Design Component Analysis

### 2.1 Break Down the Architecture
**Think systematically about:**
- What are the major components identified in the design?
- How do these components interact with each other?
- Which components are foundational (needed by others) vs. dependent (rely on others)?
- What external systems or APIs does the design integrate with?

### 2.2 Identify Implementation Layers
**Consider the following layers in order:**
1. **Data Layer**: Database schemas, data models, storage mechanisms
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Core algorithms, business rules, processing logic
3. **Service Layer**: APIs, microservices, integration points
4. **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces, frontend components
5. **Integration Layer**: External system connections, third-party services

**Reasoning:** This layered approach ensures you build from the foundation up, avoiding dependencies on unimplemented components.

## Step 3: Task Sequencing Strategy

### 3.1 Determine Development Flow
**Ask yourself:**
- What needs to exist before other components can be built?
- Which components can be developed in parallel?
- Where are the critical integration points that could cause bottlenecks?
- What represents the "minimum viable" version of this feature?

### 3.2 Plan Validation Points
**Strategic thinking:**
- At what points can I test core functionality without the full system?
- How can I validate business logic before adding user interface complexity?
- Where should I implement automated tests to catch regressions early?
- What are the riskiest integrations that need early validation?

## Step 4: Task Decomposition Process

### 4.1 Start with Major Phases
**Break down implementation into 4-6 major phases:**
1. **Setup and Foundation**: Basic infrastructure, configuration, core data structures
2. **Core Business Logic**: Essential algorithms and business rules implementation
3. **Data Integration**: Database setup, data access layers, external API connections
4. **User Interface**: Frontend components, user interaction flows
5. **Integration and Testing**: System integration, comprehensive testing
6. **Refinement and Edge Cases**: Error handling, performance optimization, edge cases

### 4.2 Decompose Each Phase into Specific Tasks
**For each phase, think through:**

**What specific files need to be created or modified?**
- Consider the exact filenames and directory structure
- Think about configuration files, test files, and implementation files
- Plan for both production code and supporting test code

**What specific functions or components need implementation?**
- Break down large components into smaller, implementable units
- Consider input/output specifications for each function
- Think about error handling and validation requirements

**What tests need to be written?**
- Unit tests for individual functions and components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows (automated, not manual)

### 4.3 Task Dependency Mapping
**For each task, consider:**
- What previous tasks must be completed first?
- What outputs from this task are needed by subsequent tasks?
- Are there any tasks that can be worked on in parallel?

## Step 5: Task Specification and Documentation

### 5.1 Write Clear Task Descriptions
**For each task, formulate:**

**Primary Objective (Task Title)**
- Start with an action verb (Implement, Create, Write, Modify, Test)
- Be specific about what component/function is being worked on
- Include the primary deliverable

**Example:** "Implement user authentication service with JWT token generation"

### 5.2 Add Supporting Context
**Under each task, include:**

**Requirements Reference**
- Which specific requirement(s) this task addresses
- Reference granular sub-requirements, not just high-level user stories
- Note any acceptance criteria from the requirements

**Implementation Details**
- Specific files to create or modify
- Key functions or methods to implement
- Dependencies on previous tasks
- Expected inputs and outputs

**Testing Expectations**
- What tests should be written
- What scenarios need validation
- How to verify the task is complete

## Step 6: Quality Review and Validation

### 6.1 Coverage Analysis
**Systematically verify:**
- Every functional requirement has corresponding implementation tasks
- Every technical requirement is addressed through specific coding activities
- All design components are covered by implementation tasks
- No requirements are overlooked or partially addressed

### 6.2 Sequence Validation
**Review the task order:**
- Can each task be completed with only the outputs from previous tasks?
- Are there any circular dependencies?
- Is the complexity progression manageable (no sudden jumps in difficulty)?
- Are validation points strategically placed?

### 6.3 Scope Verification
**Ensure focus on coding activities:**
- Every task involves writing, modifying, or testing code
- No tasks require user feedback, deployment, or operational activities
- All tasks can be completed within a development environment
- Tasks are specific enough for immediate implementation

## Step 7: Implementation Plan Finalization

### 7.1 Structure the Final Plan
**Format as a numbered checkbox list:**
```
1. [ ] Task description with clear coding objective
   - Requirement reference: REQ-ID or specific sub-requirement
   - Files to create/modify: List specific filenames
   - Dependencies: Previous task numbers
   - Testing: What tests to write

1.1 [ ] Sub-task if the main task needs decomposition
    - Specific implementation details
    - More granular requirement references
```

### 7.2 Final Review Questions
**Before presenting the plan, ask yourself:**
- Is every task actionable by a developer today?
- Does the sequence make logical sense?
- Are all requirements covered?
- Is the testing strategy comprehensive?
- Can each task be completed independently once its dependencies are met?

## Step 8: Approval and Iteration

### 8.1 Present for Review
**When presenting your implementation plan:**
- Highlight how it addresses all requirements
- Explain the sequencing rationale
- Point out key validation checkpoints
- Note any assumptions or decisions made during planning

### 8.2 Iteration Process
**If changes are requested:**
- Determine if changes affect requirements (return to requirements phase)
- Assess if changes require design modifications (return to design phase)
- For task-level changes, revise the implementation plan accordingly
- Always seek explicit approval after modifications

**Continue this cycle until you receive clear approval such as "yes," "approved," or "looks good."**
