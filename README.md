# Requirements Are All You Need

Vibe coding sucks if you donâ€™t burn money for Claude Code.

=> A comprehensive, detailed requirements document with autocomplete support from Copilot, combined with your coding skills, is the best approach. (and smart use of claude code free)

## Overall Workflow

1. Draft your raw requirements with as much detail as possible. This might include your current project structure, codebase documentation, etc.
2. Use `requirements.prompt` to improve your requirements.
3. Use `follow_up_questions.prompt` to enhance your requirements and finalize a **Requirements Document**.
4. Steps 2 and 3 can be used in reverse order.
5. Use `design.prompt` to design the process of developing new features/requirements.
6. Use `task.prompt` to create a to-do list for implementation.


## End
This should keep your brain alive. 

An interactive app to support this workflow will be released in the near future.
